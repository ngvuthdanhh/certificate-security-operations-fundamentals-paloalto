# 03 — Log Analysis & SIEM

## Querying patterns
- Filter → aggregate → outlier/threshold → join

## Correlation
- Sequence (A then B), frequency (N in T), suppression (noise windows)

## Tuning
- Whitelists, exception lists, rule versioning, QA

## Saved artifacts
- `queries/` (if you export), rule cards with intent, FP notes
